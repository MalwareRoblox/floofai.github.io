🐾 Floof AI: Terms of Service + Privacy Policy

Last Updated: April 19, 2025
created with floof, love, and zero data theft :3

💖 Privacy Policy

Floof AI is built to be simple, offline, and safe. we care more about making u giggle than collecting your info. here’s what you need to know:

1. No Login = No Personal Info
we don’t have a login system. that means we can’t and don’t collect personal info. yay!

2. We Collect Nothing
no emails, no usernames, not even your favorite color. zero data is collected. period.

3. Chat Data Lives On Your Device
all convos happen on your own computer. after 3 messages, older messages disappear automatically to keep things speedy. nothing is ever sent to us.

4. No Sharing
since we don’t store anything, we don’t share anything either. not with anyone.

5. No Security Measures... Because We Don’t Have Access
we don’t use encryption or protection for your data — because we don’t have your data. if you choose to enter private info (which is against the TOS), that’s entirely your responsibility.

6. No Advertising
Floof doesn’t spy on you and doesn’t try to sell you stuff. this is a vibes-only zone 💅

7. No Retention
we don’t retain any data, because again, we never collect it in the first place.

8. Children’s Privacy
Floof is safe for kids 13+. we follow COPPA because we don’t collect anything that would violate it anyway.

9. No Cookies 🍪
there are no cookies or tracking tools. this isn’t a website — Floof is installed on your own device.

10. Contact
got questions? wanna say hi? feel eepy and just wanna vent?
📧 oquistf@gmail.com

📜 Terms of Service

by using Floof AI, you agree to these rules. they’re here to keep things safe, fun, and not full of weirdos.

1. Who Can Use Floof?
Users must be 13 years or older.
If you’re under 13, get a parent or go play Minecraft or smth.
Do not use Floof for illegal stuff.
She does not give medical, legal, or financial advice. she’s a catgirl, not a therapist.
2. What You Can Use Floof For

venting about how eepy you are 😴
just remember to verify anything important — Floof is not a replacement for real facts or professionals.

3. What You Can’t Do
don’t make us add a scary font here. here’s what’s NOT okay:

🚫 hate speech
🚫 harassment or bullying
🚫 talking about crimes in a positive way ("arson is pog" = no.)
🚫 illegal stuff of any kind
🚫 sending private/personal info to Floof — this is strictly against the rules
4. Content Filtering
Floof uses LLaMA’s built-in filters to block naughty stuff. they’re not perfect, but please don’t try to be clever and break them.

5. Modding & Open Source
Floof is open source! you can:

view the code
edit it
make spin-offs (Floof but goth?? Floof but speaks only in pirate?? go wild)
but if you make something cursed or illegal... that’s YOUR mess, not ours 😌
6. License
we use an open-source license. please credit properly and don’t be an evil capitalist or whatever.

7. We Are Not Responsible
if you injure yourself using Floof in your toaster oven
if you have a weird convo and get your feelings hurt
if the FBI knocks on your door because of something you did
basically: you do it, you own it.
8. No Banning System
no accounts = no bans. if you break the rules, Floof won’t stop you. but we still think you’re lame if you do.

9. Commercial Use
wanna use Floof in your business or game or magical girl startup?
👉 email us first: oquistf@gmail.com

10. No Loopholes, Smartypants
don’t try to exploit weird gray areas in the rules.
if it feels wrong, it probably is. if you find a loophole, report it like a hero:

thank you for respecting the Floof 🐾
now go have fun and be nice, silly little human 💖
